## *I. Applying Simple linear regression to predict sales:*

### **Data Exploration:**
<br/>
**1. Reading Advertising data from the file into a data frame:**
```{R}
advertising = read.csv("Advertising.csv")
```

<br/>  
**2. 
<br/>
    i. Structure of the dataset:**
```{R}
str(advertising)
```
The dataset contains 200 observations and four variables: the money that is spent on TV, newspaper, or radio ads and the sales in thousand dollars. **We want to study the relationship between sales and TV ads.**

<br/>  
**3. 
<br/>
    i. Scatterplot to analyse correlation between TV ads and sales:**
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
attach(advertising)
```
    
```{R}
plot(sales ~ TV, col = "#22B3C8", ylab = "Sales", xlab = "TV", main = "Sales vs TV ads", cex.lab = 0.8, cex.main = 0.9)
```
From the scatterplot we can say there exists a positive correlation between sales and TV ads.
